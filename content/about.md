   I'm a photographer and naval architect based in New Hampshire. I've lived in New England my whole life - from Connecticut to Maine.

<p>
    My primary work, Eastern Americana, documents the functional remnants scattered across the New England landscape. I grew up learning to read these traces and now spend my time following old maps to forgotten sites, photographing what remains.

    On the water, I race aboard Wild Blue, a J/122 out of Portland, ME, and photograph the maritime world - yacht racing, working waterfronts, commercial shipping.

    I work across multiple formats and print traditional processes in my darkroom. In 2022, I founded <a href="https://www.instagram.com/newenglandanalog" target="_blank" style="color: var(--text-main); text-decoration: underline;">New England Analog</a>, a community for film photographers in the Northeast.
